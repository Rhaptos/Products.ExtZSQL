INSTALLing ExtZSQL

 This product installs like most other Zope products. Simply uncompress
 the distribution file and place the resultant 'ExtZSQL' directory
 in your products folder.

 In a simple Zope install, based at ZOPE, this is located at::

  ZOPE/lib/python/Products

 In an instance_home type installation, where your instance is at
 'INSTANCE', this it located at::

  INSTANCE/Products

 Then restart Zope, and everything should be done.
